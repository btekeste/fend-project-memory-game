## Instructions

The Memory Game is the classic card game where you have to match cards with the same figure. This game was implemented with 16 cards, start rating 1 to 3 and a timer to track user performance. The Restart icon allow you to reset the game with reshuffled cards and 3 star rating.
This project was forked from Udacity Front-End program and evaluated by Udacity code reviewers.
